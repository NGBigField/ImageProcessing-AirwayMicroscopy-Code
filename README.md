# ImageProcessing-AirwayMicroscopy-Code


## About:

This is a MATLAB app designed for the segmentation of living cells as seen through various microscopic techniques.
## Creators:
Tomer Arama, Nir Gutman
## Background

### Brief Background:
- A research in the Sznitman Biofluids Lab in the Technion have suggests a fluid-dynamic based cause of damage to preborn infants during life-saving ventilation.

- Silicon real-size models of the upper airways of preterm babies were developed. On them, living cells were grown and then ventilated, to investigate the cause of damage during these procedures.

- Our study utilizes different types of imagery in order to identify and quantify the damage caused to the tissues.
